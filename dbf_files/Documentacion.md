El enabezado del archivo sigue el siguiente formato:

|Byte	|	Contents						|Description	|						
|-----|---------------------|--------------------|
|0		|	1 byte	|Valid dBASE for Windows table file, bits 0-2 indicate version number: 3 for dBASE Level 5, 4 for dBASE Level 7. |
|			|											|Bit 3 and bit 7 indicate presence of a dBASE IV or dBASE for Windows memo file; bits 4-6 indicate the presence of a dBASE IV SQL table; bit 7 indicates the presence of any .DBT memo file (either a dBASE III PLUS type or a dBASE IV or dBASE for Windows memo file).  |
|1-3	|	3 bytes							|Date of last update; in YYMMDD format.  Each byte contains the number as a binary.  YY is added to a base of 1900 decimal to determine the actual year. Therefore, YY has possible values from 0x00-0xFF, which allows for a range from 1900-2155.                       |
|4-7	|	32-bit  						|number	Number of records in the table. (Least significant byte first.)    |
|8-9	|	16-bit  						|number	Number of bytes in the header. (Least significant byte first.)  |
|10-11|	16-bit  						|number	Number of bytes in the record. (Least significant byte first.)       |
|12-13|	2 bytes							|Reserved; filled with zeros.  |

|16-27|	12 bytes |Reserved for multi-user processing.|
|28 |	1  byte |Production MDX flag; 0x01 if a production .MDX file exists for this table; 0x00 if no .MDX file exists.|
|29 | 1 byte |Language driver ID.  |
|30-31|	2 bytes	|Reserved; filled with zeros.  |
|32-63|	32 bytes	|Language driver name.    |

|n+1	|  1 byte	|0x0D stored as the Field Descriptor terminator. |
|n+2	| See below for calculations of size			|	Field Properties Structure|

n above is the last byte in the field descriptor array. The size of the array depends on the number of fields in the table file.

(Foreign = in the other table,  Local = in this table)

## Property Data
For standard properties, everything is stored exactly as it is in the Table records. Custom property data is stored as the Name string, followed immediately by the Value string, and a null terminator. The Constraint text is stored as a null-terminated string.
Table Records
The records follow the header in the table file. Data records are preceded by one byte, that is, a space (0x20) if the record is not deleted, an asterisk (0x2A) if the record is deleted. Fields are packed into records without field separators or record terminators. The end of the file is marked by a single byte, with the end-of-file marker, an OEM code page character value of 26 (0x1A).
## Storage of dBASE Data Types
Except for autoincrement fields, all types are initialized to binary zeroes. In addition, any fields which have been assigned a default property will contain the default value.

|Symbol	|Data Type	|Description|
|---|---|--- |
|B |Binary, a string	|10 digits representing a .DBT block number. The number is stored as a string, right justified and padded with blanks.|
|C |Character	        |All OEM code page characters - padded with blanks to the width of the field.|
|D |Date              |8 bytes - date stored as a string in the format YYYYMMDD.|
|N |Numeric           |Number stored as a string, right justified, and padded with blanks to the width of the field. |
|L |Logical           |1 byte - initialized to 0x20 (space) otherwise T or F.|
|M |Memo, a string	  |10 digits (bytes) representing a .DBT block number. The number is stored as a string, right justified and padded with blanks.|
|@ |Timestamp         |8 bytes - two longs, first for date, second for time.  The date is the number of days since  01/01/4713 BC. Time is hours * 3600000L + minutes * 60000L + Seconds * 1000L|
|I |Long              |4 bytes. Leftmost bit used to indicate sign, 0 negative.|
|+ |Autoincrement	    |Same as a Long|
|F |Float             |Number stored as a string, right justified, and padded with blanks to the width of the field. |
|O |Double            |8 bytes - no conversions, stored as a double.|
|G |OLE               |10 digits (bytes) representing a .DBT block number. The number is stored as a string, right justified and padded with blanks.|

## Binary, Memo, OLE Fields and .DBT Files
Binary, memo, and OLE fields store data in .DBT files consisting of blocks numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, etc.). SET BLOCKSIZE determines the size of each block. The first block in the .DBT file, block 0, is the .DBT file header.
Each binary, memo, or OLE field of each record in the .DBF file contains the number of the block (in OEM code page values) where the field's data actually begins. If a field contains no data, the .DBF file contains blanks (0x20) rather than a number.

When data is changed in a field, the block numbers may also change and the number in the .DBF may be changed to reflect the new location.
